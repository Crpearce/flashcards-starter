# Flash Cards

## Abstract
Ever wanted to create a flashcards set to study?  This project creates a program that will simulate a set of flash cards to study while working through the command line.  The user will have the ablility to see questions, take a guess, receive feedback, and also see a final score of correct guesses at the end of the round.  By focusing on TDD, we are able to test each piece of the object-oriended application.  Goals for the project included implementing ES6 classes, using modular reusable code that follows the SRP, and implementing a robust testing suite.
